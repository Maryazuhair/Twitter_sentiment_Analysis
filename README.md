# Twitter_sentiment_Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets from Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset contains tweets that have been pre-labeled with sentiment for training and testing purposes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for sentiment analysis by removing noise, such as special characters, stop words, and performing tokenization and stemming.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical form.
Sentiment Classification: Applying various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment classification.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset contains tweets that are labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant content and prepare it for model training.
